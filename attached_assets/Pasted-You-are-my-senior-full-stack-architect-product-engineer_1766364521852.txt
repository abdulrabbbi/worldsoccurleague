You are my senior full-stack architect + product engineer. I need you to DESIGN (not fully implement) a comprehensive Admin Panel + Admin API for the World Soccer Leagues / USA Soccer Leagues platform. This admin system must control ALL modules and ALL third-party integrations while enforcing role-based permissions and supporting a “template-style” data contributor model.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
The front end hierarchy is already built. Pro soccer data comes from SportMonks (or equivalent). All lower-level data comes from our Grassroots API. The Admin Panel must manage:
- Data ingestion + verification + moderation
- Third-party integrations configuration + health monitoring
- Content/news management
- Users, roles, contributor scopes
- Ads (AdButler) inventory and geo targeting
- Community + marketplace integrations (3rd party via API)
- Shop + affiliate links + tracking
- Chatbot/AI assistant configuration
- QA/testing tools and logs

PRIMARY GOAL:
Deliver a production-ready blueprint/spec for an Admin Panel + Admin API that a dev team can build quickly and correctly, with clear modules, permissions, data models, and workflows.

MODULES THE ADMIN PANEL MUST INCLUDE:
1) USERS & ROLES
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) + scoped permissions
   - Roles:
     * Super Admin (platform owner)
     * Product Admin (global configuration)
     * Regional Admin (state-level)
     * Data Partner Admin (league/school/club level)
     * Team Manager/Captain
     * Fan Club Organizer
     * Pickup Organizer
     * Content Editor (news/posts)
     * Support/Moderator
     * Read-only Auditor
   - Scope rules: users can only manage data within assigned State/City/Org/Competition.

2) DATA CONTRIBUTOR “TEMPLATE” SYSTEM (CORE FEATURE)
   - Template assignment per contributor/org:
     * College Template
     * High School Template
     * Youth Club/League Template
     * Adult Sanctioned League Template
     * Pickup Template
     * Fan Club Template
   - Admin can create/clone/edit templates, enforce required fields, validation rules, and review states.
   - Bulk import tools (CSV/JSON upload) with field mapping + error reporting.

3) GRASSROOTS API MANAGEMENT
   - Entity management (States/Cities/Organizations/Competitions/Teams/Venues/Seasons/Matches/Standings/Rosters)
   - Verification workflow tiers:
     Unverified -> Community Verified -> Partner Verified -> Admin Verified
   - Approval queue for submissions and edits
   - Audit logs (who changed what/when) + rollback
   - Data freshness indicators + reminders

4) PRO DATA INTEGRATION (SPORTMONKS OR OTHER)
   - Store API keys/secrets securely
   - Mapping rules: SportMonks entities -> our display model (leagues/teams/players/matches)
   - Sync controls: manual “pull now” + scheduled sync
   - Webhook handling if available
   - De-duplication rules and conflict resolution with Grassroots where needed (e.g., USL2 vs local data)

5) TEAM PASS / EXTERNAL SOURCE CONNECTORS
   - “Connector” framework UI:
     * Add connector (TeamPass, etc.)
     * Configure auth
     * Choose sync scope (league/team/season)
     * Map external fields -> our schema
     * Sync schedule + logs
     * Error handling + retries
   - Data provenance display: show source per record (manual vs partner vs TeamPass vs API)

6) CONTENT MANAGEMENT (NEWS, POSTS, MATCH REPORTS, EVENTS)
   - News/Announcements per level (league/team/school/club/fan club)
   - Match reports/recaps
   - Events calendar (tryouts, tournaments, trainings, watch parties)
   - Documents (rules/waivers/handbooks) as URL-based assets
   - Media library (logos/photos/videos links)
   - Push notification feed references (do not implement push; just admin configuration hooks)

7) ADS MANAGEMENT (ADBUTLER)
   - Ad zones (global, national, state, city)
   - Banner placements by app section (home, league pages, team pages, community, etc.)
   - Geo targeting rules + scheduling
   - Impression/click reporting dashboard
   - Fallback ads and compliance rules

8) COMMUNITY INTEGRATION (3RD PARTY, e.g., BetterMode)
   - SSO strategy (admin config)
   - Group mapping: states/cities/fan clubs/teams -> community groups
   - Moderation settings + reporting (via API hooks)
   - Content sync rules (optional)
   - Display embedding configuration

9) MARKETPLACE INTEGRATION (3RD PARTY)
   - Vendor/item moderation settings
   - Category configuration (soccer items + general items)
   - Fraud/reporting hooks
   - Geographic filters
   - Commission/fee settings (if applicable)

10) SHOP / AFFILIATE MANAGEMENT
   - Shop categories (gear, apparel, tickets, travel, training tools)
   - Affiliate partner configuration (Expedia/Booking/etc.)
   - Link management + UTM tracking rules
   - Reporting (clicks, conversions if available via affiliate reporting import)

11) CHATBOT / AI ASSISTANT MANAGEMENT
   - Chatbot instances (global + module-specific bots)
   - Knowledge base sources (docs/FAQs/manuals/links)
   - Safety filters + allowed topics
   - Usage reporting
   - “Escalate to support” workflow config
   - Per-section bot behavior settings (league pages vs community vs help)

12) QA / TESTING / MONITORING (MUST HAVE)
   - Integration health dashboard (SportMonks, Grassroots, AdButler, Community, Marketplace, Shop affiliates, Chatbot)
   - Logs viewer (requests/errors)
   - Test tools: “validate data mapping”, “simulate API response”, “run sync dry-run”
   - Status page view for admins
   - Environment config: dev/staging/prod toggles

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED IN OUTPUT:
A) Admin Panel Information Architecture (menu structure + modules)
B) RBAC Permission Matrix (roles x capabilities)
C) Admin Data Model additions (admin-specific tables/collections: users, roles, scopes, audit logs, connectors, sync jobs, integration configs)
D) Core workflows (step-by-step):
   - onboarding a new data partner (college, youth league, etc.)
   - approving a submission/edit
   - setting up a TeamPass connector and syncing
   - configuring AdButler zones and mapping placements
   - enabling community SSO and mapping groups
E) Admin API endpoint list (REST) with example payloads for:
   - auth + user management
   - template management
   - approvals + verification
   - connectors + sync jobs + logs
   - integration config endpoints
   - ads config endpoints
F) UI page list with recommended fields and actions per page
G) Implementation notes:
   - suggest stack (Postgres + Prisma or similar; or NoSQL option)
   - multi-tenant considerations (future: World + continents)
   - security practices (secrets, least privilege, audit trails)
   - scalability + caching suggestions

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT build full production code; design/spec only.
- Be extremely specific and structured.
- Assume the app must scale to all 50 states and multiple countries/continents later.
- Output must be immediately usable as a developer blueprint.
