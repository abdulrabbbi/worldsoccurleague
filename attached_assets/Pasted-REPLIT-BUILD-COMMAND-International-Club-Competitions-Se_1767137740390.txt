REPLIT BUILD COMMAND — International + Club Competitions (Separate from Continents)

Goal: Build two new “Competition” sections that are NOT inside the Continents hierarchy. These sections must appear in two places and be identical in both places:
	1.	Favorites Setup Screen (first-time onboarding, where users choose favorites)
	2.	Main App Browse Menu / Dropdown (for browsing after setup)

These two sections must be displayed and behave the same in both places, and the favorites chosen in Setup must be the same saved favorites used throughout the app.

⸻

A) WHERE THESE SECTIONS MUST APPEAR (BOTH PLACES)

1) Favorites Setup Screen (Onboarding)

Add two new expandable dropdown sections at the same level as the existing Favorites categories.

2) Main App Browse Dropdown/Menu (After Setup)

Add the same two expandable dropdown sections in the Browse navigation so users can browse competitions anytime and add/remove favorites without returning to onboarding.

Important:
	•	These sections must be separate from and not nested inside “Continents & Leagues.”
	•	“Continents & Leagues” remains the place for browsing: World → Continent → Country → League → Team/Player.
	•	The competition sections below are “shortcut hubs” so users can favorite and browse major competitions without confusion.

⸻

B) TOP-LEVEL SECTION NAMES (USE EXACT LABELS)

Create these two top-level sections (exact text):
	1.	International Tournaments (National Teams)
	2.	Club Tournaments (Continental + Global)

These must appear exactly with the same text in both the Favorites Setup screen AND the main Browse dropdown/menu.

⸻

C) EXACT MENU CONTENT + HIERARCHY (USE THIS EXACT STRUCTURE)

1) International Tournaments (National Teams)

This section is for national teams only (countries), including final tournaments + qualifying.

Inside this section, build these groups (as subheadings/expandable groups):

Group 1: FIFA (National Teams)
	•	FIFA World Cup
	•	World Cup Qualifying
	•	AFC (Asia) Qualifying
	•	CAF (Africa) Qualifying
	•	CONCACAF (North/Central America & Caribbean) Qualifying
	•	CONMEBOL (South America) Qualifying
	•	OFC (Oceania) Qualifying
	•	UEFA (Europe) Qualifying
	•	Intercontinental Playoffs (optional toggle; include as an item even if data is added later)

Group 2: Continental Championships (National Teams)
	•	UEFA European Championship (EURO)
	•	EURO Qualifying
	•	CAF Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)
	•	AFCON Qualifying
	•	AFC Asian Cup
	•	Asian Cup Qualifying
	•	CONCACAF Gold Cup
	•	Gold Cup Qualifying / Prelims
	•	CONMEBOL Copa América
	•	OFC Nations Cup
	•	Nations Cup Qualifying

Group 3: Other National Team Competitions (Optional Now, Ready Later)
(Include these as selectable placeholders even if not populated immediately)
	•	UEFA Nations League
	•	CONCACAF Nations League

⸻

2) Club Tournaments (Continental + Global)

This section is for club competitions only (teams/club tournaments), including global tournaments and continental champions-league equivalents.

Inside this section, build these groups (as subheadings/expandable groups):

Group 1: Global (FIFA) — Clubs
	•	FIFA Club World Cup
	•	FIFA Intercontinental Cup (optional; include as an item placeholder)

Group 2: Europe (UEFA) — Clubs
	•	UEFA Champions League
	•	UEFA Europa League
	•	UEFA Conference League

Group 3: South America (CONMEBOL) — Clubs
	•	Copa Libertadores
	•	Copa Sudamericana
	•	Recopa Sudamericana (optional placeholder)

Group 4: North/Central America & Caribbean (CONCACAF) — Clubs
	•	CONCACAF Champions Cup

Group 5: Africa (CAF) — Clubs
	•	CAF Champions League
	•	CAF Confederation Cup
	•	CAF Super Cup (optional placeholder)

Group 6: Asia (AFC) — Clubs
	•	AFC Champions League Elite
	•	AFC Champions League Two
	•	AFC Challenge League (optional placeholder)

Group 7: Oceania (OFC) — Clubs
	•	OFC Champions League

⸻

D) FAVORITES BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)

1) Selection UI (in BOTH places)
	•	Each competition item must have a favorite toggle (star/heart/checkbox).
	•	Users can favorite:
	•	the main tournament (e.g., “FIFA World Cup”)
	•	the qualifying category (e.g., “UEFA (Europe) Qualifying”)
	•	the continental tournaments (e.g., “UEFA Champions League”, “Copa Libertadores”, “AFCON”)

2) One Saved Source of Truth
	•	A favorite selected in Favorites Setup must immediately appear as favorited in:
	•	the main Browse dropdown/menu
	•	the user profile favorites
	•	the user feed/filter logic later
	•	A favorite added/removed in Browse must also update the user’s favorites (same database record).

⸻

E) DATA MODEL REQUIREMENTS (SO BACKEND + FUTURE API WORKS)

Store each selectable item as a generic “CompetitionFavoriteEntity” with these fields (minimum):
	•	entity_id (unique stable ID)
	•	entity_type (enum):
	•	national_tournament
	•	national_qualifying
	•	club_tournament
	•	global_club_tournament
	•	organizer (enum/string):
	•	FIFA, UEFA, AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC
	•	competition_name (exact display text shown in UI)
	•	category_group (the group label inside the section, e.g. “FIFA (National Teams)” or “Europe (UEFA) — Clubs”)
	•	section_name (must be either):
	•	“International Tournaments (National Teams)”
	•	“Club Tournaments (Continental + Global)”
	•	Optional but recommended fields (create now for future expansion):
	•	gender (Men/Women)
	•	age_group (Senior/U-23/U-20/U-17)
	•	season_year (string or int)
	•	api_mapping_key (for later mapping to SportMonks/other API IDs)

Important Implementation Rule:
Even if fixtures/standings are not wired today, these items must still be created as selectable + storable favorites now, and later can be mapped to live API competitions without changing the UI structure.

⸻

F) UI RULES (TO AVOID CONFUSION)
	•	Do NOT place these competitions under the Continents hierarchy.
	•	Keep the Continents hierarchy clean for browsing leagues/teams/players.
	•	These two sections are “quick access competition hubs” for:
	•	World Cup + qualifiers
	•	EURO/AFCON/Asian Cup/Gold Cup etc.
	•	Champions League equivalents per confederation
	•	FIFA Club World Cup (and optional Intercontinental Cup)

⸻

G) FINAL CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
	1.	Both new sections appear in Favorites Setup AND Main Browse dropdown.
	2.	Labels match exactly in both places.
	3.	Hierarchy matches exactly in both places.
	4.	Favoriting works in both places and updates the same saved favorites list.
	5.	Continents hierarchy remains separate and unchanged.
