Thanks — good to hear auth is running smoothly.

Let me be very clear on priorities so we don’t lose time or build the wrong things.

1️⃣ Do NOT focus on the logo right now

The logo is not the priority. It can be refined later.
What matters first is structure, hierarchy, and data flow.

⸻

2️⃣ Primary focus: implement the core app structure from Figma

I want you to start implementing the actual product experience, not just styling.

Specifically:

A) League hierarchy & navigation (highest priority)
Implement the core browsing flow exactly like the Figma intent:

World → Continent → Country → League → Team → Player

This should include:
	•	World Soccer Leagues landing view
	•	Continent selection
	•	Country pages
	•	League pages (standings, fixtures placeholders)
	•	Team pages
	•	Player pages

⚠️ Important rule:
NO hardcoded teams, leagues, or players.
Everything must be dynamic placeholders ready to be populated via APIs.

⸻

B) Page scaffolding (MVP pages)
Please implement the following pages/components as functional shells:
	•	League page (tabs for Standings / Fixtures / Results)
	•	Team page (Squad / Fixtures / Table position)
	•	Player profile page
	•	Match page (scoreline + event timeline placeholder)
	•	Global search page (can return mocked results for now)

These do not need full data yet — they need:
	•	Correct layout
	•	Correct routing
	•	Correct component structure

⸻

3️⃣ Styling: align with Figma AFTER structure

Once the hierarchy and pages exist:
	•	Adjust colors, spacing, typography to match Figma
	•	Match overall “ESPN + Kicker.de” clean feel
	•	Mobile-first layout is critical

Styling comes after navigation and page structure.

⸻

4️⃣ What NOT to do

Please do NOT:
	•	Manually enter teams, leagues, or players
	•	Build static demo content
	•	Reorganize the hierarchy into separate categories (National / Pro / College, etc.)

The hierarchy must be one continuous vertical flow, not segmented.

⸻

5️⃣ Success checkpoint

We’re aligned if, after this phase:
	•	I can click from World → League → Team → Player
	•	Pages load cleanly with placeholders
	•	The structure is 100% API-ready
	•	USA Soccer Leagues can later plug into the same hierarchy

⸻

If helpful, I’m happy to prioritize one flow first (e.g. World → Europe → England → Premier League → Team) as the reference implementation.

Once this is in place, we’ll move to:
	•	SportMonks API integration
	•	Grassroots API hooks
	•	Favorites & personalization

Let’s lock the foundation first.
