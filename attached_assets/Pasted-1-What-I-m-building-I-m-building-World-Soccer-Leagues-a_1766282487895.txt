1) What I’m building

I’m building World Soccer Leagues, a web app (mobile-first) that acts like a “soccer version of ESPN + Kicker.de,” but organized globally and designed to scale into a full platform.

The app must let users browse soccer in a single continuous hierarchy:

World → Continent/Region → Country → League/Competition → Club/Team → Player → Match/Stats

The UI should be clean, fast, and highly familiar to soccer fans. It must support real-time match info, standings, squads, player profiles, and match stats from a professional soccer API, plus lower-level soccer data (college, high school, youth, sanctioned leagues, pickup) from my own Grassroots API.

⸻

2) Core rule (very important)

No teams, players, schools, leagues, or stats should ever be hardcoded or manually typed into the UI.
All lists, profiles, standings, schedules, etc. must be empty placeholders/components that populate dynamically from APIs.
	•	Pro / worldwide data: SportMonks API (or equivalent provider)
	•	Lower tiers (US grassroots + future global grassroots): My Grassroots API (custom database + admin/data contributor tools)

⸻

3) Primary navigation & UX (mobile-first)

Top bar should include:
	•	Search
	•	Profile
	•	Notifications
	•	Settings

Bottom navigation should include:
	•	Home
	•	Standings
	•	Community
	•	Chatbot
	•	Menu (All Leagues / Browse)

The browsing experience should feel like:
	•	Kicker.de for browsing leagues/teams/players
	•	ESPN style for user profile setup and favorites

⸻

4) Key features (MVP)

A) Browse & Discovery
	•	Browse by World/Continent/Country/League
	•	League pages: standings, fixtures, results, top scorers, discipline (if API supports)
	•	Team pages: squad, fixtures/results, table position, basic stats
	•	Player pages: bio, club, appearances/goals/assists (as supported by API)
	•	Match pages: live score, events timeline, lineups, stats (as available)

B) Search
Global search that can search across:
	•	Countries
	•	Leagues
	•	Teams
	•	Players
Search results should be grouped and clickable.

C) Favorites & Personalization
Users can favorite:
	•	Countries
	•	Leagues
	•	Teams
	•	Players

Home feed should prioritize:
	•	Favorited teams’ matches
	•	Current competitions the user follows
	•	“Today’s matches” view

⸻

5) USA Soccer Leagues “layer” inside World Soccer Leagues

Under World → select USA Soccer Leagues, the user should be able to browse:

National Teams → Professional → Semi-Pro → Amateur → College → High School → Youth → Sanctioned Leagues → Pickup Soccer

From College downward, location becomes critical:
State → City → League/School/Club → Team

This lower tier is mostly powered by Grassroots API, not SportMonks.

⸻

6) Data architecture (high-level)

The system must support multiple data sources cleanly:
	•	Provider API (SportMonks): pro leagues, clubs, players, matches, standings
	•	Grassroots API (custom): US lower-tier + local leagues + pickup soccer + fan clubs/bars later

The app should normalize into common objects:
	•	Country
	•	Competition/League
	•	Team
	•	Player
	•	Match
	•	Venue (optional)
	•	Standings row
	•	Stats payload (per match/team/player)

Use IDs and mapping so the UI can display content consistently even if different sources power different tiers.

⸻

7) Admin + Data Contributor system (required)

I need a system that allows verified contributors (leagues/schools/clubs) to input and maintain data for grassroots tiers.

Roles:
	•	Super Admin
	•	Verified Data Contributor (paid in future)
	•	Read-only / user

Contributor capabilities (Grassroots):
	•	Create leagues/competitions
	•	Add teams/clubs/schools
	•	Add rosters/players (basic)
	•	Add fixtures/results
	•	Add locations (state/city)
	•	Moderate/verify updates

This should not be “everything through one admin panel only.” It must be structured so contributors can maintain their own data safely.

⸻

8) Community, Marketplace, Ads (Phase 2 hooks)

I want the architecture to be ready for plug-ins / integrations:
	•	Community (BetterMode or similar)
	•	Marketplace (Facebook Marketplace style)
	•	Banner ads with regional targeting (Ad platform integration)

Even if these aren’t built in MVP, the app should be designed so these modules can be added cleanly.

⸻

9) Tech expectations for Replit build
	•	Build as a modern web app (responsive / mobile-first)
	•	Clean routing for pages: /world, /continent, /country, /league, /team, /player, /match
	•	API-first data fetching with caching where helpful
	•	Auth for user accounts (favorites, profile)
	•	Basic analytics hooks (events like favorite added, match viewed)

⸻

10) Success criteria

The MVP is successful if:
	1.	The hierarchy navigation is correct and intuitive
	2.	The UI loads real data entirely from APIs (no manual hardcoding)
	3.	Users can search and favorite teams/leagues/players
	4.	USA lower tiers can be powered by Grassroots API with state/city browsing
	5.	The foundation is clean enough to scale into community + marketplace + ads
