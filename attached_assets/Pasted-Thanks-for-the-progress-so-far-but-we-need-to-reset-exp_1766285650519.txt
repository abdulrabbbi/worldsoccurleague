Thanks for the progress so far — but we need to reset expectations:

1) This must be a Figma-first, pixel-perfect clone (no improvising)

Please clone/duplicate the Figma design exactly as-is.
That means same layout, spacing, typography, icons, button styles, card styles, and flow.

✅ Use Figma as the source of truth
❌ Do not substitute “close enough” components, colors, or layouts

2) Fix the logo immediately (wrong logo is being used)

I uploaded my official WSL logo, but a different one is appearing in the app.
Please replace the current logo everywhere with my uploaded WSL logo and ensure it matches the exact placement/size from Figma (Login + any other screens).

3) Match the color scheme + design tokens exactly

Right now, the feel is drifting. Please pull the exact values from Figma and implement them as global theme tokens:
	•	Primary (buttons/CTAs)
	•	Secondary / Navy
	•	Background
	•	Border color
	•	Text colors
	•	Radius values (cards/inputs/buttons)
	•	Shadow style

No guessing colors. Use exact hex codes from Figma.

4) Match the flow + hierarchy exactly (current build is missing a lot)

The current screens are only a small portion. You must implement the full intended hierarchy/flows from Figma.

Also: do not manually type leagues (MLS/USL/etc.) as static UI content.
All pages must be API-ready placeholders — the structure exists, data loads later.

5) “Definition of Done” for this phase (how we’ll measure it)

This phase is complete only when:
	•	The screens look identical to Figma (pixel-level close)
	•	Logo is correct everywhere
	•	Colors/typography/spacing match Figma tokens
	•	The intended hierarchy/navigation is implemented (not a partial version)
	•	No hardcoded teams/leagues/players in UI

6) Process request (to prevent drift)

Please do this in order:
	1.	Confirm you are using Figma Inspect + exported assets
	2.	Implement shared components (buttons, inputs, cards, header, list rows)
	3.	Implement screens using those components
	4.	I review side-by-side vs Figma

If anything is unclear, ask before filling gaps with assumptions.
