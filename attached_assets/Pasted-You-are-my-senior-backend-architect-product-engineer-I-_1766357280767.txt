You are my senior backend architect + product engineer. I need you to design (NOT fully implement) a “Grassroots API” that functions like SportMonks, but for ALL lower-level U.S. soccer + fan club data, and it must populate the UI automatically. Output must be implementation-ready and extremely detailed.

GOAL:
Create a Grassroots API architecture that mirrors how SportMonks populates pro leagues, but for:
- College soccer (all divisions) with location search State -> City
- High school soccer by State -> City -> School
- Youth soccer clubs/leagues/teams by State -> City
- Adult sanctioned leagues/teams by State -> City
- Pickup soccer (events/groups) by State -> City
- Fan clubs/supporter groups by State -> City (including pubs/bars/meeting spots, match watch events)
Include ability to connect to/ingest from external systems like TeamPass (and similar platforms) to retrieve rosters, schedules, standings, payments/registration links, and more where available.

IMPORTANT UI HIERARCHY (already built in front end; your design must populate it):
USA Soccer Leagues
- National
  - Men
  - Women
- Professional Soccer (all leagues) [handled by SportMonks]
- College Soccer (all divisions; location lookup)
- High School (location)
- Youth Soccer (location)
- Adult Soccer (location)
- Pick-Up Soccer (location)
- Fan Clubs (location)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
Grassroots must not only support standings/teams/schedules. It must support “content” and “operations” too — like a full league portal.

CONTENT & OPERATIONS FEATURES TO SUPPORT (MUST BE IN SCHEMA + TEMPLATES + ENDPOINTS):
For College/High School/Youth/Adult Sanctioned Leagues:
- News posts / announcements (title/body/date/tags/attachments)
- Match reports / recaps
- Club/league communications (email/social links; push notification feed references)
- Events calendar (tryouts, tournaments, trainings, camps, meetings, fundraisers)
- Tournaments (brackets, groups, rules, entry fees, registration link)
- Registrations (registration link, deadlines, pricing ranges; do NOT store card data)
- Team info (roster, coaches, contacts, uniforms/colors, logos, sponsor info)
- League rules & documents (PDF links: rules, waivers, handbooks)
- Venues/fields (address, geo coords, parking notes, lighting, surface, field count)
- Discipline (optional): cards/suspensions/notes (for sanctioned leagues)
- Stats (optional/light): goals, assists, clean sheets at league/team/player levels
- Media: photos/videos links; streaming links (if available)
- Recruiting/Tryouts (college + youth): dates, eligibility, contact, forms
- Affiliations: sanctioned body (USSF/USYS/UPS, state associations, school district, conference)
- Sponsors/partners (name/logo/url)

For Pickup Soccer:
- Keep lightweight but include:
  - Organizer, location, recurring schedule, skill level, cost (free/$), rules, RSVP/capacity, chat link, last-updated, safety guidelines.

For Fan Clubs:
- Supporters group profile + supported teams/countries
- Meeting spots (pub/bar) with address + geo coords + schedule
- Match watch events (date/time/opponent/competition/location)
- Membership info (optional), socials, contact, photos, recurring meetups

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU (deliverables):
1) DATA MODEL / SCHEMA (tables or collections)
   - Provide entities and relationships for:
     - Country, State, City
     - Organizations (schools, clubs, leagues, associations)
     - Competitions (leagues, conferences, divisions)
     - Seasons
     - Teams
     - Players (optional but include)
     - Staff/coaches
     - Venues/fields
     - Matches
     - Schedules
     - Standings
     - Rosters
     - Stats (lightweight)
     - News/Posts/Announcements
     - Match Reports/Recaps
     - Documents/Files (store URLs + metadata)
     - Events (tryouts, tournaments, trainings, meetings)
     - Tournaments (structure + links)
     - Registration links + fees metadata
     - Sponsors/Partners
     - External links (web, socials, streaming)
     - Data sources + provenance (manual, verified partner, TeamPass ingestion, etc.)
     - Verification flags + audit trails
   - Include required vs optional fields
   - Include unique IDs + slugs
   - Include indexing strategy for fast State/City and Team/League search

2) “TEMPLATE-STYLE” DATA INPUT SYSTEM + PERMISSIONS
   We must allow contributors to input ONLY their scope (e.g., one college, one league, one high school, one youth club) via templates without giving access to everything.
   - Define roles:
     - Super Admin
     - Regional Admin (state-level)
     - Verified Partner Org (league/school/club)
     - Team Manager/Captain
     - Fan Club Organizer
     - Pickup Organizer
     - Public user submission (unverified)
   - Define permission matrix + workflows.
   - Create Templates for each category with REQUIRED fields (and optional blocks):
     A) College Template (division/conference; school; teams; staff; venue; schedule; roster; news; events; docs; tryouts; recruiting; streaming links)
     B) High School Template (school/district; teams; season; schedule; roster; venue; news; events; docs; tryouts)
     C) Youth Club/League Template (club; teams; age groups; coaches; schedule; tournaments; registration; sponsors; news; events; docs)
     D) Adult Sanctioned League Template (league; divisions; teams; schedule; standings; discipline; registration; rules/docs; news; events; sponsors)
     E) Pickup Template (location; recurring sessions; organizer; RSVP/capacity; cost; chat link; last updated)
     F) Fan Club Template (supported team/country; meeting spots; watch parties; contact; socials; photos; membership info)
   - Each template must include:
     - Required fields
     - Validation rules
     - Form section layout suggestion
     - Example JSON payload

3) API ENDPOINT SPEC (REST)
   Provide endpoint list with example requests/responses and pagination.
   Must include:
   - Location: /states, /cities?state=SC
   - Browse by hierarchy:
     /college/teams?state=SC&city=Charleston
     /highschool/schools?state=SC&city=...
     /youth/clubs?state=SC&city=...
     /adult/leagues?state=SC&city=...
     /pickup/events?state=SC&city=...&date=...
     /fanclubs?state=SC&city=...&supportedTeamId=... OR supportedCountry=...
   - Entity detail:
     /teams/{id}, /leagues/{id}, /schools/{id}, /venues/{id}
   - Schedule/standings:
     /teams/{id}/matches, /leagues/{id}/standings, /leagues/{id}/schedule
   - Content:
     /leagues/{id}/news, /teams/{id}/news, /schools/{id}/news
     /events?orgId=... , /documents?orgId=...
   - Submissions + moderation:
     /submissions (create), /submissions/{id}, /submissions/{id}/approve, /submissions/{id}/reject
     /verification/requests, /verification/{id}/approve
   - Media URL management endpoints (store URLs + metadata; no binary hosting)
   - Rate limiting + caching guidance

4) VERIFICATION + QUALITY CONTROL
   - Tiers: Unverified, Community Verified, Partner Verified, Admin Verified
   - Review workflow, change tracking, conflict resolution, data freshness fields.

5) INTEGRATION / INGESTION FROM EXTERNAL SYSTEMS (TeamPass etc.)
   MUST include 3 methods:
   A) Official API integration (preferred)
   B) Export ingestion (CSV/JSON upload)
   C) Semi-automated scrape/parse ONLY if legal/allowed; mark as optional
   For TeamPass specifically:
   - Define “ExternalSourceConnector” pattern
   - Map TeamPass -> our schema:
     players/registrations -> roster
     events -> matches/schedules
     standings -> standings
     teams -> teams
     venues -> venues
     posts/announcements -> news (if exists)
     registration links/fees -> registration metadata
   - Sync strategy: webhook if available, else scheduled pulls
   - De-duplication strategy
   - Error handling + logs + retry strategy

6) ADMIN PANEL BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
   - Contributor management + scoped access
   - Template assignment per org
   - Approval queue (submissions/news/events/docs)
   - Edit history + rollback
   - Data export per org/state
   - Moderation tools
   - Partner onboarding checklist

7) OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
   Produce answer in this exact structure:
   A) Architecture Overview (1 page)
   B) Data Model (tables/collections + relationships)
   C) Templates (A-F) with required fields + example JSON
   D) API Endpoints with example responses
   E) Verification workflow
   F) Integration plan (TeamPass connector pattern)
   G) Admin panel backend requirements
   H) Implementation notes (stack-agnostic; include Postgres option + NoSQL option)

DO NOT:
- Do not generate huge production code.
- Do not build UI.
- Do not assume professional leagues come from Grassroots API.

DO:
- Make it scalable to all 50 states.
- Make State/City search fast.
- Make it simple to onboard one college/high school/youth club/league with minimal friction.
- Ensure fan clubs can attach to supported teams/countries for World Cup discovery.
