Yes — agreed. Please switch to Autonomous Mode so you can implement this properly with full architectural control.

What I want you to build first (Core App Structure)

Your goal in this phase is to create the foundation for the league hierarchy and dynamic content.

1) Hierarchy + Dynamic Routing (required)

Implement the continuous navigation flow:

World → Continent → Country → League → Team → Player → Match

Use dynamic routes (slug + ID-based) so the pages are API-ready:
	•	/world
	•	/continent/:continentSlug
	•	/country/:countrySlug
	•	/league/:leagueId-:leagueSlug
	•	/team/:teamId-:teamSlug
	•	/player/:playerId-:playerSlug
	•	/match/:matchId

Add a Global Search route:
	•	/search

And authenticated user pages:
	•	/profile
	•	/favorites

2) Page Scaffolds (UI shells with correct layout + tabs)

Each page should exist and be navigable end-to-end, with placeholders (no hardcoded data):

League Page

Tabs:
	•	Standings
	•	Fixtures
	•	Results
	•	Stats (optional placeholder)

Team Page

Tabs:
	•	Overview
	•	Squad
	•	Fixtures/Results
	•	Table/Stats

Player Page
	•	Bio header + key stats blocks

Match Page
	•	Scoreline header
	•	Timeline/events placeholder
	•	Lineups placeholder
	•	Match stats placeholder

3) Data Model (API-ready, no hardcoding)

Create normalized types/interfaces so either API can populate the same UI:
	•	Continent { id, name, slug }
	•	Country { id, name, code, slug, continentId }
	•	League { id, name, slug, countryId, seasonId? }
	•	Team { id, name, slug, leagueId, countryId, crestUrl? }
	•	Player { id, name, slug, teamId, position?, nationality? }
	•	Match { id, homeTeamId, awayTeamId, kickoffTime, status, score }

Build the UI to consume data through a single data layer:
	•	providers/sportmonks (pro data)
	•	providers/grassroots (lower tiers / later)

Even if you mock the provider responses initially, structure it as if it’s live.

4) Critical rule

✅ Pages must render using dynamic placeholders and fetched data objects.
❌ Do not manually enter teams/leagues/players into UI components.

5) Navigation + Layout
	•	Top bar: Search, Profile, Notifications, Settings
	•	Bottom nav: Home, Standings, Community (placeholder), Chatbot (placeholder), Menu/Browse
	•	Mobile-first, clean ESPN/Kicker-style layout.

6) Success checkpoint for this phase

I should be able to:
	1.	Navigate World → Continent → Country → League → Team → Player without dead ends
	2.	See proper page layouts/tabs with placeholder data
	3.	Confirm routing + data types are ready for SportMonks + Grassroots integration

Proceed with this as the foundation. Once complete, next phase is SportMonks integration + Favorites.
